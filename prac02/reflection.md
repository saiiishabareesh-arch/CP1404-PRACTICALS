What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched 100% of the lecture videos so far. I make it a priority to 
stay up-to-date each week so that I fully understand the concepts before starting the practical tasks.

What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch lecture videos in the evenings at home, where it’s quiet and I can focus 
without distractions. I schedule 1–2 hours after dinner, three times a week, 
which helps me stay consistent and engaged with the content.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am doing well at keeping up with the practical work on time and ensuring that I apply good coding ]
practices such as using constants instead of magic numbers, descriptive variable names, 
and proper function structure. I also use Git version control properly, with meaningful
commit messages, so my work remains organised and professional.


What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

One thing I want to change is to practice more coding without relying on the IDE. 
Since handwritten coding is encouraged, I will spend some extra time writing short
programs on paper to strengthen my syntax knowledge and memory.

What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

In Practical 1, I sometimes placed calculations inside the decision structures, which repeated
the same code. For Practical 2, I have already improved by keeping calculations outside the 
decision structures and ensuring that functions follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am doing really well in terms of writing clean, maintainable,
and well-structured programs. I carefully follow the instructions,
use proper function design with docstrings, and always test my
programs with different inputs. I am also disciplined with GitHub usage,
committing regularly with professional commit messages,
which will also help me build a strong coding portfolio.
